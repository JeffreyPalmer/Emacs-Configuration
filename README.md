This is just a github version of my emacs configuration, for my sanity. :)

Uses [`use-package`][1] to manage package installation and
configuration. Emacs should bootstrap `use-package` and install all
other packages automatically when starting up for the first time.

Install the [OS X version of emacs][2], and make sure that the
font [Fira Code][3] is installed.

Getting started with a new checkout:
```
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install --with-official-icon emacs-mac
```
